# Platelets (Pure)

A simple boilerplate boiled up from different boilerplates, that probably used stuff from other boilerplates and resulted in a boilerplate. Boilerplate.

The pure branch contains the basic template, but with Pure CSS as well as Normalize (v2) for a bit more oompf.

## Assumptions

* No support below IE 8 (apart from a browse happy link).
* jQuery will be used (and used well) in the site. If you can go without, [please do](http://remysharp.com/2013/04/19/i-know-jquery-now-what/).
* The site is being run on some kind of server and index.html is at root. If you want to run server-free, you'll need to drop some slashes from index.html.

## Extra stuff

* .htaccess is pulled directly from h5bp with one addition to get rid of php file extentions (probably could be better/used for other things).
