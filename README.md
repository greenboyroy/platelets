# Boilerplate (Basic)

A simple boilerplate boiled up from different boilerplates, that probably used ideas from other boilerplates and resulted in a boilerplate. Boilerplate.

## Assumptions

* No support below IE 8 (apart from a browse happy link).
* jQuery will be used (and used well) in the site. If you can go without, [please do](http://remysharp.com/2013/04/19/i-know-jquery-now-what/).

## Extra stuff

* .htaccess is pulled directly from h5bp with one addition to get rid of php file extentions (probably could be better/used for other things).
* Alternative versions are in the works. I want to incorporate [Pure](http://purecss.io) and start a [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) workflow based on recommendations from Harry Roberts [@csswizardry](https://twitter.com/csswizardry).
